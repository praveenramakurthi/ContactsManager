This diagram represents a high-level overview of interactions between frontend and backend components. Here's a breakdown of the interactions:

1. The frontend initiates a request to the backend to retrieve contacts using a `/GET` request.
2. The backend processes the request and fetches contacts from the database.
3. The backend sends the retrieved contacts data back to the frontend.
4. The frontend displays the contacts list to the user.
5. When a user adds a new contact, the frontend sends a `/POST` request to the backend with the new contact data.
6. The backend processes the request, adds the new contact to the database, and sends a confirmation message back to the frontend.
7. When a user deletes a contact, the frontend sends a `/DELETE` request to the backend with the contact ID to be deleted.
8. The backend processes the request, deletes the specified contact from the database, and sends a confirmation message back to the frontend.

This sequence diagram illustrates the basic interactions between frontend and backend components for retrieving, creating, and deleting contacts in the contacts manager application. Depending on your specific requirements and implementation details, the interactions and components may vary.
